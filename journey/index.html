<h1>A API Journey Through My API Design Research</h1>
<p>I provide several ways to explore my research, working to make as much of my research explorable for those getting started, as well as others who are ready for some more advanced planning concepts.</p>
<p><a href="complete/index.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-journey.png" align="right" width="230" /></a></p>
<p>You can explore by the level: <a href="essentials/index.html">just the essentials</a>, and <a href="complete/index.html">complete edition</a>, or by the zone: <a href="technology/index.html">technology</a>, <a href="business/index.html">business</a>, and <a href="politics/index.html">politics</a>.</p>
<p>I am using the subway map analogy, to help me organize my research, but also allow others to experience it in different modes, as well as through the different lenses each zone provides.</p>
<p>I am finding this approach isn't just about you exploring my research, it is how I actually explore, evolve, and better understand the API space.</p>
<p>Like any public transit system, this journey will be evolving daily.</p>
