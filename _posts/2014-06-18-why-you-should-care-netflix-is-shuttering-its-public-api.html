<p>Netflix has decided to shut down public API support for third-party developers.An interesting decision, and in my opinion a bad one.Launched six years ago, the Netflix API provided developers a way to access content from their streaming and DVD catalog.That helped the company grow and gave developers a way to build new experiences around Netflix content (for example Flixster).Last year the company said it would stop issuing new API keys to developers and last Friday they announced that their API will stop working on November 14th for most developers, except a few key partners and applications.</p>
