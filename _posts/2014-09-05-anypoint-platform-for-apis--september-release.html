<p>I am excited to announce that our September release of Anypoint Platform for APIs is now live.This update to the platform provides a variety of performance enhancements as well as three new features:
API developers can now import and export API versions to better support the full development lifecycle of APIs.Developers can create and test an API in a development environment and then export that API for promotion to a staging or production environment.When exporting an API version, developers can export the RAML file, portal, policies and endpoint for the version.We are excited to announce that Anypoint Platform users can now access our API for application management directly in order to build custom workflows for creating and managing applications.</p>
