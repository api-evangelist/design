<p>Waiting for APIs to be designed and implemented can wind up wasting a lot of application development time because, without an API in place, development teams can’t really work on the rest of the application.To address that issue, WillowTree Apps this week announced the release of a rapid API design and virtualization tool, dubbed Monkeypod, that is accessed via the cloud.WillowTree Apps VP of Sotware Development, Gregg Carrier, says that as a developer of mobile applications for enterprise organizations, WillowTree Apps regularly ran into issues where its development partners were held up waiting for one API or another to be completed.To allow those developers to keep working on other aspects of the application, WillowTree Apps decided to build a tool that would enable organizations to rapidly create a virtual instance of an API using the Swagger API framework that developers could invoke in order to test various aspects of the application without the API having to be finalized.Based on HTTP and JSON, Monkeypod is designed to create a Swagger specification that is compatible with other Swagger tools, such as code generation and sandbox documentation, Carrier says.</p>
