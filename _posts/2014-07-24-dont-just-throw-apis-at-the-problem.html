<p>One thing I’ve witnessed over the last few months as I’ve worked with dozens of customers is that, despite the fact that companies already have hundreds and thousands of APIs (anything that is an “interface” is an API  in my mind),  companies are still adding more.This includes the thousands of interfaces exposed by an SAP or Oracle, or the hundreds of SOAP web services, FTP jobs, asynchronous batch jobs, newer REST APIs.And let’s not forget the companies that have been acquired or partnered with, and all of their interfaces from their internal systems.So there is a no shortage of APIs – far from it in fact.So,  a “lack” of APIs is definitely not a problem.</p>
