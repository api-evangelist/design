<p>A few weeks ago I talked about how Bash is more powerful than you might think.My point was that sometimes choosing the best tool for the job means skipping over the newer, sexier, but more dependency-ridden language in favor of the simpler and ubiquitous alternative.It’s all about the end goal, not the means of getting there.I discussed this with respect to a simple script that could be used to manage a remote system, but similar examples are everywhere -- even a few places you might not expect, like Web APIs.Of course, I’m not really suggesting Bash for CGI work -- that’s the true home of the brave.</p>
