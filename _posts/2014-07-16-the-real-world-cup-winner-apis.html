<p>What a world cup!I do feel bad for 50% of the MuleSoft team though (given that we’ve got a big office in Buenos Aires).It’s exciting though, because this was a very exhilarating competition that truly reached a fever pitch here in the US where “football” is traditionally a game with pads, helmets, and ball that doesn’t really roll.What was really interesting was how this was truly a, “World Cup powered by APIs.” World Cup organizer FIFA has stated that more than a billion fans worldwide accessed information about the tournament through its digital platforms.</p>
