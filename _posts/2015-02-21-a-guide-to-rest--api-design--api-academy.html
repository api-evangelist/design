<p>CA recently released a new eBook A Guide to REST & API Design that is based (in part) on a talk I gave at the 2012 Code PaLOUsa in Louisville, KY.The approach is a bit atypical for most REST papers or presentations.I decided to focus on some of the broader issues around design in general and then relate that to Fieldings REST style for distributed software.In the process of offering up guidance on how to design and implement APIs for the Web, I call on advice from psychologist Abraham Maslow, industrial designers Charles and Ray Eames and human-computer interaction guru Donald Norman.They all bolster many of the key principles Roy Fielding relied upon when he wrote his 2000 dissertation Architectural Styles & the Design of Network-based Software Architectures – the one that contains the definition of REST (Representational State Transfer) that so many talk about today.</p>
