<p>The battle between software giants Oracle and Google hit close to home again last week, when a Federal Court of Appeals overturned a 2-year-old ruling by a lower court and established that APIs are entitled to copyright protection.The first reaction from most people is: how strange!After all, APIs are just the specification of how a software system or service behaves – call it this way, send it this information, get back that information – so how is that possibly something copyrightable?It’s not like a book, or a painting, or even software… And the second reaction, from many in the API world, is: no!Do we really need to worry about being sued for adopting some popular API pattern to which developers have grown accustomed, and that’s been tried and tested by a major player?</p>
