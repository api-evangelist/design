<p>For those not familiar with Azure SQL, it is a fully managed relational database service in Microsoft’s Azure cloud. Since this is a managed service, we are not concerned with the underlying database infrastructure. Microsoft has abstracted all of that for us and we are only concerned with managing our data within our SQL Instance. For more information on Azure SQL please refer to the following  link.In order to complete all of the steps in this blog post we will need a Microsoft Azure account, a MuleSoft CloudHub account and MuleSoft’s AnyPoint Studio – Early Access platform.</p>
