Iâ€™ve written about this topic before, in an effort to understand the possible incentives for API providers to generate their own machine readable API definitions in formats like Swagger and API Blueprint.These machine readable definitions for APIs and microservices are important to have, but not everyone produces them by default for their APIs, and honestly nobody is going to create them until there are enough incentives to sweeten the pot.It helps me to walk through this story again, understand the incentives for generating API definitions to date, in hopes of better understanding where we are going.Early on Wordnik developed Swagger, to generate:
Interactive Documentation - Making learning about an API, a hands-on experience, accelerating time to first API call.Generate Server-Side Code - Automatic generation of server side skeletons that take out much of the repetitive work of API deployment.</p>
