<p>As an API provider it’s important to consider how consumers interact with your API.While most people leave this task to the very end, API design should, in fact, begin with clear and concise documentation.This practice is often called “Documentation Driven Design” or “Documentation Driven Development” and is followed by many practitioners around the world.Tom Preston-Werner, founder of GitHub, clearly outlines some advantages of this approach:
