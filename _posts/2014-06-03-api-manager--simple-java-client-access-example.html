<p>I recently had a customer wanting to build a simple UI to maintain additional filtering data associated to a defined “Contract” contained within API Manager.This code would have to run outside of the MuleSoft eco-system, as a service, within a JAVA Data Layer container environment.My goal was to develop a very simple JAVA API Manager Client Access Example, whose concept prototype could be used as a basis to construct a necessary Mashup of API Manager Resources and Custom Client oriented resources. A primary emphasis is to understand the OAUTH2 Authentication exchange requirements.To begin you can review the API Manager Console located at https://anypoint.</p>
