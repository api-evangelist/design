<p>REST APIs are everywhere, but there are still use cases that justify a RESTless path. 
Broadcom’s OpenNSL, a recently unveiled software platform that enables the development of applications on top of Broadcom’s StrataXGS network switches, is a good example of the fact that there’s room for non-REST APIs in a REST-dominated world.The OpenNSL platform, which is targeted at original equipment manufacturers, independent software vendors, and network operators, is composed of a set of APIs that align to Broadcom’s SDK.Why didn’t Broadcom build OpenNSL as a REST API?A company representative explained:
“OpenNSL is not an API that is meant to run across the network.</p>
