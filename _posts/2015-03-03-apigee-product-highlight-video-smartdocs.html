<p>Up-to-date documentation is a critical way for developers and partners to understand the APIs that enterprises work so hard to produce.And these days, static documentation isnt enoughâ€”reducing the Time-To-First-Request (TTFR) is an important sign of engagement.To help adoption and make it easier to maintain content, we introduced Apigee SmartDocs in 2014.SmartDocs is detailed, method-level API documentation thats also interactive.It is generated from the formal, defined structure of an API, called an API model, and it supports WADL and Swagger 1.</p>
