<p>If you spend any time reading about API design or working with APIs you will likely have come across the notion of paging response data.  Paging has been used in the HTML web for many years as a method to provide users with a fast response to their searches.  I normally spend my time advocating that  Web APIs should emulate the HTML web more, but in this case I believe there are better ways than slicing results into arbitrary pages of data.Is it necessary?To provide some context, it is worth asking a few questions about why we do paging.</p>
