<p>Data paging, that is, the retrieval of a large amount of data through a series of smaller data retrievals, is a non-trivial problem.Through Lokad, we have implemented about a dozen of extensive API integrations, and reviewed a few dozens of other APIs as well.The conclusion is that as soon as paging is involved, nearly all web APIs get it wrong.Obviously, rock-solid APIs like the ones offered by Azure or AWS are getting it right, but those outstanding APIs are exceptions rather than the norm.The obvious pattern that doesnt work
I have lost count of the APIs that propose the following broken pattern to page through their data, a purchase order history for example:
Where page is the page number and pagesize the number of orders to be retrieved.</p>
