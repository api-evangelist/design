This is another story that came to mind while listening to the last episode of Traffic and Weather.As John and Steve were talking about the API definition format Swagger switching from Reverb to SmartBear (thanks for shout-out about my Swagger post), they were discussing how Microsoft is using Swagger as part of platform operations, and made sure and reminded us listeners that all this has been done before.Bringing up a never-ending theme  in the world of APIs, that we just cant seem to shake loose.When people bring this up, what do they mean?Yes, modern API definitions like Swagger, are very much like earlier incarnations of WSDL and WADL.</p>
