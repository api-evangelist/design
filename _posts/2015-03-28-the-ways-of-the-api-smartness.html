<p>An API must be smart to ensure that consumers will want to use it and remain dumb when they consume it.Whether an API is dark internal, open external or everything in between (cf.Mark O’Neil classification), its provider (both human and application) must take whatever steps to ensure that this API (and everything surrounding it) is smart enough so the consumer (both human and application) do not need to be as skilled as the provider concerning the field of this API or what run behind it to use it.Depending on your API and your needs, you can achieve the API smartness by using some of these ways:
Diving into a single of these ways could will take many posts even entire books and maybe movies, and there are probably other ways.I’m myself only at the beginning of this journey to API smartness, I’ll try with this post to give you a glimpse of these ways based on what I have learned and experimented so far.</p>
