<p>Over on the Dropbox Developer Blog, Steve Marx takes a look at how many status codes an API should have.APIs make use of standard HTTP status codes, but as Marx points out, there are some factors that could affect the number of codes that should be used.In specific, Marx highlighted the differences between API clients and web browsers, as well as the intended audience, as aspects to consider when deciding on an HTTP status code strategy.Originally part of the HTTP 0.9 spec defined by Tim Berners-Lee, HTTP status codes are the standard response codes used in any client-server communication.</p>
