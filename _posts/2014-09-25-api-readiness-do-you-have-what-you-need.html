<p>I recently had the opportunity to sit down with Clark Buckner of TechnologyAdvice and talk about one of my favorite subjectsâ€¦ APIs.Already a burgeoning industry, the API economy has sprouted wings recently and is now driving much of the software business economy, both at the enterprise and the start-level.As a result, we spend a lot of time discussing strategies for designing APIs and enticing third-party developers to use them.But is that really the most important thing to worry about?In the end, the real users of your APIs are the people on the other end of the applications, trying to upload photos of their new baby or do their mobile banking transactions or unlock their car doors.</p>
