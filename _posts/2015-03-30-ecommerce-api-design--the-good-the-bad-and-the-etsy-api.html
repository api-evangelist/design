<p>I think it’s important to point out that Etsy, unlike most other eCommerce solutions we work with, is a representation of not just one shop but millions (billions?) of shops.This forces a mixture of authorized and unauthorized calls to retrieve information about Etsy as a whole in addition to information about a specific shop, and also creates confusion.Perhaps partitioning the API around this idea would provide more clarity.While there are hints of this with listings and receipts (Etsy’s products and orders, respectively), the current solution is neither clear nor intuitive.</p>
