{% include JB/setup %}<p>As mentioned by another review, REST is a convention, not a standardized protocol.You can design all kinds of crazy APIs with HTTP, things that are not RESTful at all, and not very clean or consistent.Ive created web services without this book, and Ive created web services that were informed by this book.I wish Id read the book before I designed my first, because the web service APIs I created guided by the Rest API Design Rulebook are significantly better -- cleaner, more consistent, better use of HTTP methods and statuses, etc.I especially had problems understanding when to use PUT and when to use POST; the rulebook approach of the text made that distinction clear.</p>
