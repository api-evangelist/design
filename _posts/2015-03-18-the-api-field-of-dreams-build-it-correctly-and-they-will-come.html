<p>This article is aimed at architects and technology leaders, as a guide to basic design concepts for application programming interfaces (API).It is not intended to be an introduction to APIs themselves, a discussion about why you might want to use an API, or a presentation of the different types of APIs and technologies available.Although the title of the article is a bit tongue in cheek, it might need a little qualification.In my opinion, you dont want to build an API that will make people come to it…you want to build one that will make people come BACK to it again and again…and make them WANT to use it.If your companys brand is big enough, your founder or CEO or sales staff has carved out some market share and most likely ensured that they will come—as soon as the word hits the street that there is an API for developers to interface with Megacorp, they will want to check it out—your job is to build an API that is so awesome that their excitement level remains high as they use your API the first time, and every subsequent time.</p>
