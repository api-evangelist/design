<p>When creating API capabilities, its important to respect existing HTTP interaction patterns and resource models that we have utilized across the platform.If the interaction pattern you are planning on doesnt fit into these patterns, please consult with an API designer.This is intended to augment the more comprehensive API Standards.If any conflict exists in guidance, API Standards should trump any guidance here.If conflicts are found, please contact API Design.</p>
