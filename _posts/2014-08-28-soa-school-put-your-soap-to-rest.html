<p>The benefits of applying the principles of SOA when catering to the IT needs of your organization are clear in a business-driven, vendor-neutral architecture.It considers all requirements from the perspective of the business process and delivers implementations in order to automate the same.The implementations themselves, driven by the same SOA principles and goals, are not bound to any one particular vendor because they are intrinsically interoperable, that is, they expose and consume Services or APIs (we use the terms interchangeably here).The service, which is the building block of SOA architecture is reusable because it is agnostic to all business processes.It is effectively resused when it forms part of a composition, which typically maps to an abstraction of a business process.</p>
