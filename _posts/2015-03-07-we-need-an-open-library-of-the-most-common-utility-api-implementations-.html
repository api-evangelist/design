I was spending time profiling APIs late last night while putting back a couple of IPAs.Yes this is what I do on a Friday night, you have a problem with that?Anyways, I was crafting Swagger definitions for the 7digital music APIs, and the I came across their territories API.The Territories API serves data about countries that 7digital operates in, data about those counties, and a one or more languages with shop urls in each country”, something that I could see being pretty useful to developers when building music apps on top of the platform.There has been numerous APIs I’ve developed in the past, where the need for some supporting, utility APIs, such as a list of states, zip codes, counties, or other resources was called for.</p>
