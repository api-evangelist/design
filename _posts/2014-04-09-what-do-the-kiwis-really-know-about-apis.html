<p>It turns out quite a bit.Media companies, postal services, newspapers and other print publishers have been talking about monetizing digital assets both to create new revenue opportunities and, quite frankly, to remain relevant in the age of the digital prosumer.New Zealand Post has embarked on a project to unlock their digital assets with APIs to create brand new revenue streams through their affiliate and partner networks.We will feature their story as one of many exciting use cases during MuleSoft’s inaugural conference – CONNECT 2014 in San Francisco, May 27-29th.We’re excited to count Salesforce, Tesla, and Box – amongst the most innovative companies in the world today – as our customers and feature their transformational CIOs – Ross Meyercord, Jay Vijayan, and Ben Haines – in our keynote sessions to discuss how each in their own unique way is fundamentally changing business patterns by becoming a Connected Company.</p>
