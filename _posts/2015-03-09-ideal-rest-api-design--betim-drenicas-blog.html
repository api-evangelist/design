<p>In mobile (tablet is included) era REST eclipsed SOAP in terms of web services.And, if we see and analyse in details both architectures (respectively architecture styles), and get environment constraints get just data what I request instead of “two hundred pages manual what I will get” is great, practical and useful.Imagine a mobile user using mobile data to get ten most popular books and consuming a SOAP service, just getting WSDL will push that month’s data invoice to limits.But coming from SOAP, with a commodity and many things defined for years, REST APIs have open a lot of debates in almost all aspects REST tends to resolve, make solution.So, after all years in designing (and consuming a lot) REST APIs I did a list of things I consider an ideal rest api design should contain.</p>
