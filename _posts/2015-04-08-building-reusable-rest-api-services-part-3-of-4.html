<p>My first post in this series of four discussed the problems and pitfalls of creating your own REST APIs.After that we looked at some of the ineffective ways that companies try to deal with the API complexity problem.Now, I want to talk about the advantages of reusable web services for general-purpose application development.The Possible Dream
