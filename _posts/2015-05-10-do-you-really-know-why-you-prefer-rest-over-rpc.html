<p>A few weeks ago I’ve seen an interesting flock of tweets initiated by this question:
This question and the tweets that followed put my brain on quite an animated discussion…
After this internal discussion, I realized that this question (and all the tweet debate that follows it) could help me highlight a dark corner of my librainry: why should I considered REST’s request style (resource oriented) better than RPC’s (operation oriented)?Is RPC’s request style so evil?Is REST’s the panacea?What RPC’s and REST’s requests styles look like
