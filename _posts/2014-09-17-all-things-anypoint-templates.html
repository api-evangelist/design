<p>Over the last few months we’ve been actively building and releasing new Anypoint Templates.Anypoint Templates are designed to make it easier and faster to go from a blank canvas to a production application.They’re bit for bit Mule applications requiring only Anypoint Studio to build and design, and are deployable both on-premises and in the cloud.Anypoint Templates are based on five common data integration patterns and can be customized and extended to fit your integration needs.So even if your use case involves different endpoints or connectors than those included in the template, they still offer a great starting point.</p>
