<p>As if HTML5 isnâ€™t new enough to many web developers, people thinking ahead to HTML6 are including native support for APIs as a first-class citizen to the in-browser application experience.Reported by SDTimes today, this is very exciting news for web application developers who ubiquitously use JSON content from REST web services, but currently have to broker that interaction between web page and back-end service through Javascript calls.How is this awesome?The simpler the API is to use, the better for everyone.Eliminating the assumption of script between visual layout and data services would raise the bar on the need for simplicity in the API, both in the structure for front-end developers to navigate as well as referencing data contained within responses from web services.</p>
