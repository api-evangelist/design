<p>When you design an API (even an internal/private one) upon an existing back office (to plug a mobile application on it for example), you should take care of one thing: an API is a display, not a window.An API’s purpose is to expose your data and data processing but an API is only a representation and you’re under no obligation to directly expose the crude reality.This is even more true if you have a bestial back-office.It’s definitely not a good idea to expose it as it is, you really must hide it behind a beautiful API.It might even brings unexpected benefits.</p>
