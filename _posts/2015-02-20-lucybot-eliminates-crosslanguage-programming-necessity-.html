<p>Startup LucyBot recently launched with the goal to ease API adoption.While APIs continue to drive the modern web, LucyBot co-founder Bobby Brennan found that ramping up on a new API was far too complicated and time consuming.Thus, Bobby and his brother Andrew Brennan launched LucyBot to provide a tool that cuts down on typical frustrations associated with integrating new APIs.Simply put, the LucyBot tool creates cross-language cookbooks for APIs. 
I realized this was the perfect way to apply my work on cross-language code automation, as REST APIs only have a few degrees of freedom, and are inherently language-agnostic, Bobby Brennan told BostInno.</p>
