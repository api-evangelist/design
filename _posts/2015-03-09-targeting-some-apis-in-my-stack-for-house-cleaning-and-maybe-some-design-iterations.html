As I look through more APIs, and I don’t just play around in their developer portal, and look at documentation, I am actually get my hands dirty generating Swagger definitions, and authenticating and making calls to an API.There is no better way to get to know an API, that generating a Swagger definition, and integrating with it—something when done, you always walk away with a new perspective.Once I get more of the APIs profiled in my API Stack, I’m going to see if I can configure my API editor to let me iterate on other people’s API designs a little bit.As an API consumer, you don’t always get a voice in the design of the next version of an API, but with API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint, you can actually make edits, and then share them back with a provider.Of course it is still up to a provider to decide on what they accept, but there is not better way to make suggestions than a machine readable API definition, that is ready to go.</p>
