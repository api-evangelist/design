<p>WSDL, WADL, RAML or Swagger, has it become a religious battle within your enterprise?Are  various development organizations wasting countless hours writing biblical essays on how their language of choice is the only right answer?Does it have to come down to a single answer for the whole enterprise or is there another way?In the summer of 2014, I did a lot of research on API Description Languages (API  DL). I was very familiar with WSDL and WADL from my years in SOA Governance so I focused my detailed research on RAML and Swagger.</p>
