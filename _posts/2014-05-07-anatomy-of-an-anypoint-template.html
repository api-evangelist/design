<p>Complete for an atomic use case: In order to build something truly useful, the most important criteria was to develop a comprehensive solution focused on the main, atomic, value of the use case.Atomic means that its the base unit of value that can be compounded either by adding other flows in parallel or in a serial order.Reusable: Itâ€™s surprising how often different people have slightly different requirements for the same base use case.Even though our templates are designed to solve particular use cases, they conform the base to base patterns which are leveraged in many variations of the same base problem.Extendible: Templates are designed to grow into a complete Enterprise SaaS Integration.</p>
