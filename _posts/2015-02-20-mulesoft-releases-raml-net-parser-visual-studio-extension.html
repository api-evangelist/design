<p>MuleSoft (parent company of ProgrammableWeb) has released a parser and Visual Studio extension for its Anypoint Platform that aim to give developers the ability to more easily work with APIs using RAML.RAML, the RESTful API Modeling Language, is based on YAML, which has become an especially popular data representation format for configuration files.Using RAML, developers can document APIs in a human-readable form, define resources and methods, detail response formats and reuse common usage patterns. 
With MuleSofts.NET RAML parser, developers can load and work with RAML documents.</p>
