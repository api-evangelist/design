<p>When I was first learning web development and the HTTP specification, I often found myself overwhelmingly confused about which verbs to use and when.I had it explained to me that most applications on the internet are CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications and that the HTTP verbs match to these actions 1 to 1.POST is a Create, GET is a Read, PATCH (or PUT) is an Update, and DELETE is a, well, Delete.But as often is the case in life, things are not always as they seem, nor are they simple.A PUT can be used to both create and update a resource.</p>
