<p>I am givng each of my primary API research sites a refresh, and first up is the home page of my API design research.As I update each home page, Im going to publish here on API Evangelist to help bring more awareness to each of the main areas Im studying.This is one of my API research sites, focused specifically on API design.My name is Kin Lane, and I am the API Evangelist, working as hard as I can to understand the world of the Application Programming Interface, widely called an API.This network of API research projects all run on Github, and is my real-time workbench, which means there is a lot of finished work present, but occasionally you will also come across areas projects that are unfinished--you have stumbled in my API design research, you will find the main API Evangelist site over here, with other links to my work.</p>
