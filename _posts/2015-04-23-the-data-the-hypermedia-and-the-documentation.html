<p>When I look at hypermedia media-types and API definition languages I feel that the frontier between data and documentation is becoming thinner as my knowledge of the API world grows and as the API world evolves.Some complain that hypermedia APIs are overloaded with useless, redundant, ugly, complex, …  data and/or tend to be hardly readable and/or are inefficient in environments where 1 byte is what separates total failure from awesome success (have you ever feared the E icon on your smartphone when using an app relying on data?).Others complain that some APIs are not developer/consumer friendly and it’s boring, hard, painful, … to find , when needed, the accurate documentation or information, wether it’s machine or human readable (have you ever feared the enigmatic 1138 error and we will not tell you more message or the cryptic understandableButEnigmaticName field while using an API?).</p>
