<p>By Alan DeLevie and Eric Mill  
We recently released the first version of our API Standards â€” a set of recommendations and guidelines for API production.It is our intention that every 18F API meet these standards, to help us ensure a baseline quality and consistency across all APIs we offer now and in the future.These standards guide the user-facing implementation details of an API.Wherever possible, the standards prescribe a goal instead of a specific technology.What was once universally recommended about APIs just a few years ago may be dated today.</p>
