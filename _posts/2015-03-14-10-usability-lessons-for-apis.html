<p>Lately Ive been thinking about what makes a good API.Its a broad topic, and a tough one - if only because as an API Designer/Developer youre working for the most critical audience of all: yourself.One night after a spontaneous tweet in response to an API Evangelist blog post, I wondered: now how different is designing a good website from designing a good API?Maybe not that much.Dont Make Me Think.</p>
