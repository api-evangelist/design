<p>Popular file storage and synchronization service Dropbox has sparked controversy with its decision to use the HTTP POST method with an API endpoint.On the Dropbox Developer Blog, F.Metsys detailed how the HTTP GET method is supposed to be used: As a rule, HTTP GET requests should not modify server state.This rule is useful because it lets intermediaries infer something about the request just by looking at the HTTP method.Metsys continued:
The Dropbox API tries to use GET for calls that don’t modify server state, but unfortunately this isn’t always possible.</p>
