<p>Here is my presentation at DevConTLV March 2015, slide by slide, with my accompanying talk and some notes.I dont write down what I say on the slides, not do I have a script, so the text is an approximation.This talk was supposed to be 20 tips to stop annoying developers, but I stopped counting at 20.Youre welcome to count along with the presentation and tell me how many there are at the end.Every example in this presentation represents an actual example Ive seen while documenting APIs.</p>
