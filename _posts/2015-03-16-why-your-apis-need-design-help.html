<p>Anything built should be built right.It doesn’t matter if it’s built of wood, carbon nanotubes or code.So it’s encouraging that the practice of User-Centered Design—getting customer feedback at every stage of a project—is catching on with APIs as well.When we think APIs, we mostly think of developers and not designers.But the experience of those who want to use your APIs isn’t just dependant of the strength and elegance of your API.</p>
