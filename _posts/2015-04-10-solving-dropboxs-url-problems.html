<p>A recent post on the Dropbox developers blog post talked about the challenges of constructing URLs due to the challenges of encoding parameters.  They proposed the idea of using encoded JSON to embed parameters in URLs.I believe URI Templates offer a much easier and cleaner way to address this issue.  This blog posts shows how.Ive talked about using a URI Template library to construct URLs before, but in this post Im going to consider the specific examples highlighted in the Dropbox post.</p>
