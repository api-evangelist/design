<p>The Application Programming Interface (API) has operations that can be consumed by the application.Lets understand with the help of a scenario where APIs play a role.Say there is a taxi company that wants to allow booking of a taxi through a mobile app or a web site.Now, this feature or operation needs to be exposed so that it can be used by clients that are developing the web sites or a mobile application.The operation to expose the cab booking will have some input and output parameters.</p>
