<p>One of the topics that came into relief for me quite clearly recently is the idea of core domains and their application in API design.This happened as part of our design meetings for BYUs University API.When I say core domain Im thinking of the concepts taught in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and made clear in Implementing Domain-Driven Design (iDDD).(Aside: if youre in OIT and would like a copy of iDDD, stop by my office.)  
 DDD uses the terminology core domain, supporting domain, and generic domain to describe three types of sortware systems you might be building or using and how your organization should relate to each.</p>
