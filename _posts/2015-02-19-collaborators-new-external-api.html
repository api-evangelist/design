<p>I’ve been with SmartBear for almost 4 years and we’ve never had an external API that could be used by our customers and partners to integrate with 3rd party tools.  If people wanted to integrate with Collaborator, they had to do so via our command line interface (CLI).  The problem with the CLI is that it doesn’t provide access to all of the great capabilities within Collaborator.  It is really just a way for users to create reviews and in some cases extract additional information from the tool.  Though this has served us well over the years, it didn’t provide us a long term scalable solution that would allow for integrations.</p>
