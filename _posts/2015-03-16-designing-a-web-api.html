<p>A Web API corresponds to an application programming interface that can leverage the Web technologies to execute processing and manipulate data.Modern Web APIs follow the REST principles to be as easy to use and lightweight as possible.Typically it provides a set of resources that exchange representations.Far from being a high level guide, we want to provide here a practical and technical guide describing how to design Web APIs and pointing out how to avoid pitfalls along the way.Itâ€™s based on our experience and feedback when implementing Web APIs.</p>
