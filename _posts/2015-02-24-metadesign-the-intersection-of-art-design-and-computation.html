<p>Editor’s note: this post originally appeared on Rune Madsen’s blog.It is reprinted here with permission.This post is about something I see as a continuing trend in the design world: the rise of the meta-designer and algorithmic design systems.Until recently, the term graphic designer was used to describe artists firmly rooted in the fine arts.Aspiring design students graduated with MFA degrees, and their curriculums were based on traditions taught by painting, sculpture, and architecture.</p>
