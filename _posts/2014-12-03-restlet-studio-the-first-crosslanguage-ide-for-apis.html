<p>The rise of API languages
Over the past few years, API languages have emerged.They let you formally describe web APIs and generate useful artifacts from both an API provider and API consumer point of view.Today, the leading languages are API Blueprint, RAML, Swagger, but there is no clear winner at this stage as each tackle the problem from a slightly different angle. WADL also pioneered API languages, but lost traction over the past years.API code editors and Studio inception
To let API developers craft new API contracts or document existing ones, each of the leading API language provides a special web based code editor.</p>
