What is it?Aggregation is the act of taking or receiving data from multiple systems and inserting into one.For example, lets say I have my customer data in three different systems, and I wanted to generate a report which uses data from all three of those systems.I could create a daily migration from each of those systems to a data repository and then query against that database.</p>
