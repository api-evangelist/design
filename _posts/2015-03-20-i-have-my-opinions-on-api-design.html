<p>So I’m going to write about them.In this context I’m really talking about REST APIs: those wonderful HTTP requests between you and some application that allow you to do all sorts of great things with your data. Most projects that I have the most fun with involve working with an API; reading about it, testing against it, building the solution with it and coming up with other crazy sh*t to do with it.Quickly, about REST
REST APIs provide a simple interface to an application over – normally – HTTP. It follows the familiar standards of other architectures: create: POST, read: GET, update: PUT/PATCH and delete: DELETE.</p>
