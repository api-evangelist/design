I was working in APISpark, playing around with different approaches to creating APIs for data stores i have in Amazon S3, Github, and in Google Spreadsheets.The cloud API deployment solution allows me to generate APIs from CSV, XML, JSON and spreadsheet stores in these locations, to a central API platform faster than I could even consider doing manually.As I’m managing a simple data API I have, I see the option to generate a “server skeleton” in the toolbar, something that is also available to me when working in the Restlet Studio.This is one of the benefits of creating machine readable API definitions like Swagger or API blueprint of your APIs.Restlet doesn’t generate server code for you from your file stores, it generates a machine readable definition of your file source, then lets you generate a “server skeleton” from that.</p>
