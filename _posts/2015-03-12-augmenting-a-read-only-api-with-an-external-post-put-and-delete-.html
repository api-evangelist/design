<p>11 Mar 2015   
I am revisiting some work that I started when I was working in Washington DC as a Presidential Innovation Fellow(PIF).Actually there are several things going on here, a sort of perfect storm of API design thoughts.After reviewing hundreds of APIs, including APIs in the federal government, you start to want to either go mad, or start making changes to the API designs you are exposed to.This leads me to the other layer to this story, a common question I get regularly, regarding whether or not there are any write APIs in the federal government—meaning, can you POST, or PUT to a common government resources.Write APIs are important in government, and their scarcity reflect some of the systemic illnesses I feel exists in government IT.</p>
