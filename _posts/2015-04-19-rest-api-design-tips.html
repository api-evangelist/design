<p>For the server side of Pollable we iterated on the REST API several times and learned a lot the hard way.And this excellent article is great for design tips.We’re using RESTful calls of Json only and https only; much of this deals with the design of the Json objects.Of course you should understand the client’s use case.But more than that: You should understand what libraries they’re using.</p>
