    about: The web brings a lot of tools to the table, make sure and learn about existing
      web technologies, and put them to use across the API design process.

    category: Best Practices
    category_about: What are the best practices for API design. Do not confuse this
      with behavior when consuming an API. This is about best practices specifically
      in the world of API design. This should be about having an overarching philosophy,
      and ethos when it comes to API design, that reflects the technical, and business
      goals of a company.
