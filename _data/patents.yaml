  name: API and business language schema design framework for message exchanges
  summary: ""
  abstract: A server system facilitates an exchange of messages with a remote client
    application. The server system includes a plurality of application servers hosting
    a plurality of applications. A plurality of Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
    provides programmatic access to the plurality of applications, each of the APIs
    being configured to receive request messages compiled by the remote client application.
    First and second request messages, respectively addressed to first and second
    APIs of the plurality of APIs by a remote client application, each comprise at
    least one common data component. Further, the first request message includes a
    first payload specific to the first API, and the second request message includes
    a payload specific to the second API.

  name: API notebook tool
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques for an application programming interface (API) notebook tool
    are disclosed. In some implementations, an API notebook is a tool, framework,
    and ecosystem that enables easy exploration of services that expose APIs, creation
    and documentation of examples, use cases and workflows, and publishing and collaboration
    of APIs. In some embodiments, systems, processes, and computer program products
    for an API notebook tool include receiving a request for a client for calling
    an API for a service, and dynamically generating the client for the API for the
    service.
