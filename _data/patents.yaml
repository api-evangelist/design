  name: API and business language schema design framework for message exchanges
  summary: ""
  abstract: A server system facilitates an exchange of messages with a remote client
    application. The server system includes a plurality of application servers hosting
    a plurality of applications. A plurality of Application Program Interfaces (APIs)
    provides programmatic access to the plurality of applications, each of the APIs
    being configured to receive request messages compiled by the remote client application.
    First and second request messages, respectively addressed to first and second
    APIs of the plurality of APIs by a remote client application, each comprise at
    least one common data component. Further, the first request message includes a
    first payload specific to the first API, and the second request message includes
    a payload specific to the second API.

  name: Bipod-mounted mortar fire control system
  summary: ""
  abstract: An apparatus for mounting an electronics unit, such as a digital pointing
    device, to a mortar bipod may include a pair of spaced-apart, generally parallel
    mounting brackets having respective inner faces. A pair of support rails may be
    fixed to opposite outer edges of the mounting brackets. A pair of support rods
    may be fixed between opposite lower portions of the mounting brackets. A lower
    guide rod housing may be fixed to first ends of the support rails. A pair of fire
    control guide rods may have first ends fixed to the lower guide rod housing. A
    plurality of shock mounts may have respective bases and tops. The shock mount
    bases may be fixed to the respective inner faces of the mounting brackets. The
    electronics unit may include a top plate fixed thereto. A pair of side plates
    may be fixed to the top plate. The side plates may extend generally perpendicularly
    from the top plate. The tops of the shock mounts may be fixed to the side plates.

  name: Methods and systems for simplifying object mapping for external interfaces
  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and systems for simplifying object mapping for external interfaces.
    At least two client requests for action may be received from an external interface
    wherein each client request may be evaluated sequentially or concurrently in a
    governed and non-blocking technique. Each client request may be associated to
    a logical object in order to minimize a representational gap between the client
    request and a physical object using the logical object. Each query request may
    be responded to using the object relational mapping in order to simplify the external
    interface by minimizing the representational gap between the external interface
    and the physical object using the logical object.

  name: API notebook tool
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques for an application programming interface (API) notebook tool
    are disclosed. In some implementations, an API notebook is a tool, framework,
    and ecosystem that enables easy exploration of services that expose APIs, creation
    and documentation of examples, use cases and workflows, and publishing and collaboration
    of APIs. In some embodiments, systems, processes, and computer program products
    for an API notebook tool include receiving a request for a client for calling
    an API for a service, and dynamically generating the client for the API for the
    service.
