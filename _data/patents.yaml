  summary: ""
  abstract: A debugger casuality feature is provided. Debugger casuality is the ability
    of a cooperating debugger to associate an ordered set of casuality related threads,
    possibly originating from different processes, as a logical thread of execution.
    In an illustrative implementation, systems and methods are provided allowing for
    the execution and management of debugger casuality within a computing environment.
    In the contemplated implementation casuality hooks are provided for integration
    with calls found in software operating in a computing environment. The hooks help

  name: System and method for replicating offline scheduling transactions from a client
    to a server
  summary: ""
  abstract: A facility for replicating offline scheduling transactions directed to
    a server is provided. The facility is implemented as a client-side application
    that integrates with and utilizes components of a store-and-forward application,
    which is operable to execute on a client to guarantee that transactions submitted
    on the client are replicated and carried out on a service hosted on a remote server
    even in light of intermittent connectivity between the client, the server, and
    networks. Records describing transactions intended remote service are written
    to an outbox of the store-and-forward application on the client. When online,
    the store-and-forward application first invokes the facility, which processes
    the items in the outbox by iteratively retrieving the items from the outbox and,
    for each item, determining whether the item is a transaction intended for the
    scheduling application. If the item is intended for the scheduling application,
    the facility sends the item to the scheduling application. Otherwise, if the item
    is not intended for the scheduling application, the facility returns the item
    to the outbox for processing by other components of the store-and-forward application.
