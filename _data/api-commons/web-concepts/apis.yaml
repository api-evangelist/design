name: Web Concepts
description: The Webs Uniform Interface is based on a large and growing set of specifications.
  These specifications establish the shared concepts that providers and consumers
  of Web services can rely on. Web Concepts is providing an overview of these concepts
  and of the specifications defining them. One example for how this works is the Hypertext
  Markup Language (HTML), which defines the media type text/html and a set of link
  relation types such as alternate and section. Web Concepts provides a structured,
  quick, and interlinked overview of these and many more concepts that together establish
  the Web surface.
