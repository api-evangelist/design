name: APIMATIC
description: APIMATIC is an automatic SDK generator for Hypermedia APIs. Providing
  SDKs or client libraries not only reduces the time required for your customers to
  begin consuming your API, but also provides competitor advantage by targeting the
  variety of programming languages. While the market pressures you to release early
  and release often, you will often find yourself constrained with respect to time
  and resources. As a result, maintaining SDKs becomes untenable which ends up becoming
  a support nightmare.
