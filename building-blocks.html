<p>These are the common building blocks I have pullled from my research so far.
<table width="100%" border="0"><tr>

<a href="" id="home-name-link-514" style="color: #000;"><strong>API Gateway</strong></a><p><p>API gateways are enterprise quality solutions that are designed to expose API resources. Gateways are meant to provide a complete solution for exposing internal systems and connecting with external platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API gateways are often used to proxy and mediate existing API deployments, but may also provide solutions for connecting to other internal systems like databases, FTP, messaging and other common resources.</p>
<p>Many public APIs are exposed using frameworks, most enterprise APIs are deployed via API gateways--supporting much larger ideployments.</p></p>
